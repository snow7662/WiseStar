    "question": "A function $f$ is defined on the complex numbers by $f(z)=(a+bi)z,$ where $a_{}$ and $b_{}$ are positive numbers.  This function has the property that the image of each point in the complex plane is equidistant from that point and the origin.  Given that $|a+bi|=8$ and that $b^2=m/n,$ where $m_{}$ and $n_{}$ are relatively prime positive integers.  Find $m+n.$",

    "question": "A car travels due east at $\\frac 23$ miles per minute on a long, straight road. At the same time, a circular storm, whose radius is $51$ miles, moves southeast at $\\frac 12\\sqrt{2}$ miles per minute. At time $t=0$ , the center of the storm is $110$ miles due north of the car. At time $t=t_1$ minutes, the car enters the storm circle, and at time $t=t_2$ minutes, the car leaves the storm circle. Find $\\frac 12(t_1+t_2)$ .",
